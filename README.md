# River Dell Cyber Security Club CTF Writeups
###About
This repository is used for the purpose of creating write-ups for the various competitions that we do. What is a write-up? A write-up, in the terms of CTFs is written out "how-to-solve-this-CTF-challenge" guide to explain how we solved a specific CTF challenge in a CTF. This is primarily done for our own documentation purposes, but also to help new members of our club/team and fellow CTF competitors learn how to solve similar problems.

###Format
To keep a level of consistency, there are two Markdown files that serve as the templates:
- event-details-template.md - used for competition details.
- writeup-template.md - used for creating a write-up.

Please use these templates when creating write-ups, or adding entries for each event. Each CTF has its' own folder that contains the challenge write-ups.

Happy CTF-ing, or whatever.
